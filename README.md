Jacquard Loom Postcards WEBSITE


Process
-------

1. Initial Pattern
  * text message _"I <3 cats"_
  * *worry about images later*

2. Becoming Code
  * Input via web / processing
  * Optimize to Java bytecode if need to make smaller (pde -> class)
  * Compile to 'PostKnit', punchcard instructions (ascii, hex?)

3. Create Punchcard
  * print, punch and mail! 

4. Read Punchcard & execute
  * run through a card reader [DIY example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6auO8djKRrM)
  * two outputs:
    * On Screen: decode from PostKnit back to Processing & print original message _"I <3 cats"_
    * To Knit: output PostKnit code to knitting machine and create coded object _not sure what this looks like yet ;-)_
